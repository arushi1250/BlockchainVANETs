# Blockchain Based Secured Identity Authentication and Expeditious Revocation Framework for vehicular Networks
We propose a blockchain based authentication and revocation framework, which not only reduces the computation and communication overhead by mitigating dependency on a trusted authority for identity verification, but speedily updates the status of revocated vehicles in the shared ledger, which is updated and synchronized periodically across these trusted authorities. In the proposed scheme, vehicles obtain their Pseudo IDs from the Certificate Authority (CA), which are stored along with their certificate in the immutable authentication blockchain and the pointer corresponding to the entry in blockchain, enables the Road Side Units (RSUs) to verify the identity of a vehicle on road. Moreover, the transactional data of a vehicle also enables the revocation authorities to go for quick revocation in case of malicious vehicle detection by the RSUs. 
The original identities of the vehicles remain anonymous to both the internal and external entities of the system. The efficiency and performance of the scheme has been validated using the Omnet++ simulation environment. The proposed scheme comparatively performs well, and only minute delay is experienced due to the establishment of security requirements like encryption, decryption, verification and authorization for successful authentication and access control.
